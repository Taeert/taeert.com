A dramatic scene in a 16:9 ratio depicting a Dutch male engineer with blond hair and a Korean male engineer with black hair, miraculously coming back to life. The setting is surreal, with a blend of bright, ethereal light and shadows, creating a mystical atmosphere. Both engineers are standing up, with expressions of awe and wonder on their faces. They are wearing simple, modern clothing, and the background is a mix of abstract shapes and colors that suggest a transition from darkness to light, symbolizing their return to life. The scene is filled with a sense of amazement and the miraculous.
